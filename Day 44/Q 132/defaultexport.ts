//            Default Export

// Each module can have at most one default export. This is useful when you want to export a single primary
//  value from a module.When importing a default export, you can name the imported value anything you 
// like, as it does not rely on the name of the exported value.

export default function() {
    console.log('This is a default export');
  }
