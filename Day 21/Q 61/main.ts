// Q 61:
// Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles 
// using enums, and show one example.

// Making a list (enum) for different types of vehicles

enum vehicles {
    car,
    bike,
    truck
}
// Showing one type of vehicle from the list
console.log(vehicles.truck); // It shows 2 because enums start counting from 0
// Here, we're just checking what number the Car category got in our list.
